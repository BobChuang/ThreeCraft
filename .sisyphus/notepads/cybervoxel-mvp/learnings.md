## 2026-02-21 Task 1

- Single-player map selection is bound to `config.weather` in `Controller.startGame` and uses `Math.floor(Math.random() * weatherConfig.length)` as the random index source.
- A safe deterministic debug override can stay fully pre-check based: parse env once, validate integer/range, then only replace the chosen index value.
- Playwright QA can validate runtime config behavior by importing browser modules in `page.evaluate` and calling `controller.startGame(true)` directly.

## 2026-02-21 Task 2

- Added cyberpunk map resources by appending eight standalone `cyber*.png` textures under `src/assets/textures/blocks-clipped/` and wiring them into `src/core/loader/index.ts` imports, texture loading, nearest-filter setup, `blockTypes`, and `blockLoader`.
- Weather generation expects tuple order `[water, surface, base, nameIndex]`; new cyberpunk tuples were appended with `nameIndex = 5` without modifying existing entries.
- Runtime scene evidence can be captured deterministically by setting `config.weather` in browser runtime before starting single-player, then taking a Playwright screenshot.
