## 2026-02-21 Task 1

- Added `VITE_FIXED_MAP_INDEX` to development/production env files with empty default to preserve random selection unless explicitly set.
- Implemented deterministic override only in single-player startup pre-check path (`startGame`) without touching random algorithm internals.
- Invalid fixed index handling uses a single startup warning gate and falls back to the existing random selection path.
