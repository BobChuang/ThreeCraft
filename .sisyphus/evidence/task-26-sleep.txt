Task 26 NPC sleep/wake evidence
Date: 2026-02-22
Server: pnpm dev with VITE_FIXED_MAP_INDEX=12
URL: http://127.0.0.1:4180/

Scenario:
1) Enter single-player and read simulation NPC states near spawn
2) Teleport observer/player camera to far coordinate (4096, 80, 4096)
3) Wait 2.5s (>= several simulation ticks)
4) Read simulation NPC states again

Metrics:
- Near spawn: sleeping=0, active=10
- Far away: sleeping=10, active=0
- Far away thinking-active NPCs: 0
- Total NPCs observed: 10

Result: all off-range NPCs transitioned to sleep mode and stopped active thinking/decision activity while far from the observer.
