NPC Cadence De-sync Runtime QA Report
Date: 2026-02-23

Scope
- Runtime QA only for NPC cadence de-sync.
- No source code edits performed.

Ports
- Requested port: 4173
- Actual port used by Vite: 4175
- Evidence: `.sisyphus/evidence/npc-cadence-dev.log` shows fallback from 4173/4174 to 4175.

Methods used
1. Started dev server with log capture:
   - `pnpm dev --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4173 > .sisyphus/evidence/npc-cadence-dev.log 2>&1 &`
2. Opened app in Playwright at `http://127.0.0.1:4175/`, entered Single Player ("单人游戏").
3. Observed `AI 决策日志` and extracted latest per-NPC `执行动作` timestamps via page evaluation.
4. Captured full-page screenshot of active runtime decision log panel.
5. Stopped QA server processes cleanly (PIDs 77058, 77085).

Observed timestamp samples (same observation window)
- Nix: 11:52:01
- Flash: 11:52:01
- Skyline: 11:52:01
- Doc: 11:52:01
- Drill: 11:51:57
- Rust: 11:51:57
- Viper: 11:51:57
- Wrench: 11:51:57
- Neon: 11:51:57
- Blaze: 11:51:55

Decision execute timestamp de-sync proof (>=3 NPC)
- Blaze 11:51:55 vs Drill 11:51:57 vs Nix 11:52:01.
- These are different execute timestamps across NPCs within the same capture window, i.e., not a single fully timestamp-aligned burst for all NPCs.

Verdict
- PASS: Decision-call/execute timestamps differ across NPCs in the same observation window.
