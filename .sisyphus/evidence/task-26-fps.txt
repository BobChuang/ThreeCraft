Task 26 FPS evidence (30s window)
Date: 2026-02-23
Server start command: pnpm dev --port 4173
Port record: requested 4173, actual 4178 (from /tmp/task26-dev.log)
URL: http://127.0.0.1:4178/

Known baseline noise:
- registerSW.js 404 appears on load; treated as baseline non-blocking noise.

Steps:
1) Open URL and click "单人游戏".
2) Confirm in-game HUD visible and #fps is readable.
3) Read #fps every 500ms for 30s total (split into two contiguous 15s captures, 60 samples).

Raw stats summary (30s):
- sampleCount: 60
- averageFps: 117.02
- minFps: 53
- maxFps: 122

Raw samples (60):
120,120,121,121,115,115,121,121,120,120,121,121,120,120,109,109,121,121,121,121,120,120,120,120,120,120,97,97,121,121,53,53,122,122,120,120,121,121,121,121,121,121,121,121,121,120,120,121,121,121,121,120,120,121,121,120,120,121,121,120

Conclusion:
- This evidence now uses a full 30-second sampling window.
- FPS remains around ~120 on average, with occasional short dips.

Closure note (2026-02-23):
- Task26 performance target is considered met in this environment: average FPS 117.02 (>30 FPS target) under 10 NPC runtime.
- Environment limitations: local Vite port drift occurred (requested 4173 -> actual 4178), and baseline `registerSW.js` 404 noise remained present; both are treated as non-blocking baseline constraints.
- Scope limitation: sampling is browser runtime based (HUD `#fps`) without external profiler attachment.
